## Opening an Issue
Before creating an issue, check if you are using the latest version of the project. If you are not up-to-date, see if updating fixes your issue first.

### Reporting Security Issues
Review our Security Policy. Do not file a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

### Bug Reports and Other Issues
A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report. ✌️

## Code Contribution

Any new functionality must:

- be useful to many.
- fit naturally into what Hugo-PDF does best.
- strive not to break existing sites.
- use stable features supported by major browsers.

Any non-trivial code change needs to update an open issue. Bug fixes are, of course, always welcome.
